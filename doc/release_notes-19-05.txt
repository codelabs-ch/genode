Broadened CPU architecture support and updated tool chain
#########################################################

With the major update of Genode's tool chain and library infrastructure in
tandem, the framework gains a consistent architecture support across
x86-32, x86-64, ARM-32, RISC-V, and the new added AARCH64. This includes
the tool chain (Section [Tool chain based on GCC-8.3.0 and binutils 2.32]),
the base framework, the dynamic linker,
and the C runtime (Section [Updated dynamic linker and C runtime]).

Together with this update, we took the chance to wrap up our long-time move
away from board-specific build directories to one generic build directory
shared by multiple kernels and boards for a given CPU architecture
(Section [Unified build directories for ARM]).


Tool chain based on GCC-8.3.0 and binutils 2.32
===============================================

Genode uses a tailored tool chain based on GCC and binutils that is used
across all supported kernels and architectures.
Since the previous tool-chain update in version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/17.05#Tool_chain - 17.05],
we relied GCC-6.3. After two years, it was time for an update, motivated
by three major reasons.
First, the C++17 standard is common-place now. We Genode developers anticipate
the improvements that come with it.
Second, RISC-V and AARCH64 are now supported by mainline GCC. Up till now,
we had to maintain a custom patch set for Genode's RISC-V support. AARCH64
was not supported yet.
Third, our increasing engagement with SPARK depends on recent improvements
of the Ada compiler that is part of GCC.

With Genode 19.05, the tool chain is now based on binutils version 2.32, GCC
version 8.3.0, GDB version 8.2.1, gcov version 8.3.0, standard C++ library
version 8.3.0.

The tool chain supports x86 (32 and 64 bit), ARM, AARCH64, and RISC-V.

For C++ code, the C++17 standard is enabled by default.

The update of the tool chain presented a perfect opportunity to replace the
former use of gnatmake with a much more natural integration of Ada in Genode's
build system, using a custom ali2dep dependency-extraction tool developed
by [https://github.com/Componolit/ali2dep - Componolit].

In contrast to the previous versions, we switched to versioned installation
directory for the new tool chain. By default, it is now installed to
_/usr/local/genode/tool/19.05/_. This eases the use of different
tool-chain versions for different development branches.

:Tool-chain installation:

  [https://genode.org/download/tool-chain]

Caveats
-------

The tool-chain update required a number of adaptations throughout the
source tree, and may affect Genode users too:

* The silent fall-though within switch statements most now be replaced
  by an explicit annotation of the form
  ! [[fallthrough]]
* The 'register' keyword is no longer valid with C++17. Hence, it must
  be removed from the code.
* Types marked as 'Noncopyable' can no longer have an implicit default
  constructor. A default constructor must be provided manually.


Updated dynamic linker and C runtime
====================================

The tool-chain update is accompanied with a major update of the dynamic linker
and the C runtime to cover both the AARCH64 and RISC-V architectures in
addition to the traditional x86 and ARM architectures.


Updated C runtime to FreeBSD 12 libc
------------------------------------

FreeBSD 12 supports AARCH64 and RISC-V. Hence, by updating our C runtime,
Genode's libc support extends to those architectures now.


Lazy-binding support for RISC-V
-------------------------------

Until now, Genode's dynamic linker supported only the eager binding of
symbols at loading time on the RISC-V architecture. With the current version,
we could overcome this limitation in favor of lazy binding as used on all
other CPU architectures.


Unified build directories for ARM
=================================

In version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/17.02#Genode_Application_Binary_Interface - 17.02],
we introduced unified build directories x86, which allow us to build and
run Genode scenarios on various kernels while using only one build directory.
This concept leverages Genode's cross-kernel-binary compatibility to make
the switch from one kernel to another - like developing on base-linux and
deploying on base-nova - a seamless experience.

On ARM, this concept was held back by a third dimension. The
system-integration step does not only depend of the CPU architecture and
the kernel but also on the used board. Our traditional approach was the
use of one build directory per board. Granted, within such a build directory,
one can easily switch between different kernels - like Fiasco.OC and seL4.
But on ARM, we find an extreme proliferation of different board
configurations, which share the same CPU architecture but demand different
integration steps. This ensues large redundancies among different build
directories. Switching from one board to another - even if must binaries
happen to be exactly the same - requires an additional rebuilding effort.

With version 19.05, we took the chance to generalize the unified build
directory concept to the support of multiple boards per build directory,
greatly reducing the friction when switching kernels and boards for a given
architecture revision (like ARMv7a). This change has the following
implications:

* Drivers no longer depend on the SPEC values as configured for a build
  directory.

* All *binaries* are now *named unambiguously*. For example, the USB drivers
  for the Panda (OMAP) and Arndale (Exynos) boards where formerly called
  'usb_drv' but were different programs. They just never happened to
  appear in the same build directory. In the new version, they are named
  'panda_usb_drv' and 'arndale_usb_drv' respectively and can thereby
  happily co-exist within the same 'armv7a' build directory.

  Note that this binary renaming will likely effect existing run scripts.

* Include paths no longer hide the board details, which makes the included
  code much more easy to follow.

* Run scripts need to pick the right binary, depending on the used board.
  Since the board is no longer tied to a build directory, the selection
  of the used board has become a build-time variable 'BOARD' following
  the successful pattern of how we specify the targeted 'KERNEL'.

To avoid the pollution of run scripts with difficult conditions, we wrap
drivers needed for a particular board and use case into so-called
_drivers_ packages. Such a package can be instantiated within a generic
scenario using a nested init instance. The details about the drivers and
how they access the hardware remain nicely hidden inside this building block.

Currently, there exist _drivers_ packages for two distinct use cases:

:drivers-interactive pkgs: contain all drivers needed for simple
  interactive scenarios, including graphical output and user input.

:drivers-net pkgs: contain the drivers needed for communication over the
  network.

Whenever a run script fits one of these use cases, it can rely on the
corresponding ready-to-use drivers packages via:

! import_from_depot [depot_user]/src/[base_src] \
!                   [depot_user]/pkg/[drivers_nic_pkg] \
!                   ...

With the drivers package incorporated, the drivers subsystem can be
instantiated as follows (note the absence of any board or kernel-specific
details):

! <start name="drivers" caps="1000">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="32M" constrain_phys="yes"/>
!   <binary name="init"/>
!   <route>
!     <service name="ROM" label="config">
!       <parent label="drivers.config"/> </service>
!     <service name="Timer"> <child name="timer"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
!   <provides> <service name="Nic"/> </provides>
! </start>


Using the 'BOARD' build variable
--------------------------------

The new 'BOARD' variable selects the board to use. It can be specified
either as a 'make' command line argument (or environment variable), or
defined in the build-directory configuration (_etc/build.conf_).
The following boards are available:

:arm_v6: rpi
:arm_v7: arndale, imx53_qsb, imx53_qsb_tz, imx6q_sabrelite, imx7d_sabre,
  nit6_solox, odroid_x2, odroid_xu, panda, pbxa9, usb_armory,
  wand_quad, zynq_qemu
:x86_64: pc, linux, muen
:x86_32: pc, linux
:riscv:  spike

Modernized block-storage interfaces

    block session: remove Block::Session::Operations
    
    This patch modernizes the 'Block::Session::info' interface. Instead of
    using out parameters, the 'init' RPC function returns a compound 'Info'
    object now. The rather complicated 'Operations' struct is replaced by
    a 'writeable' attribute in the 'Info' object.
    
    Fixes #3275

    block_session: server-defined payload alignment
    
    This patch replaces the formerly fixed 2 KiB data alignment within the
    packet-stream buffer by a server-defined alignment. This has two
    benefits.
    
    First, when using block servers that provide small block sizes like 512
    bytes, we avoid fragmenting the packet-stream buffer, which occurs when
    aligning 512-byte requests at 2 KiB boundaries. This reduces meta data
    costs for the packet-stream allocator and also allows fitting more
    requests into the buffer.
    
    Second, block drivers with alignment constraints dictated by the
    hardware can now pass those constraints to the client, thereby easing
    the use of zero-copy DMA directly into the packet stream.
    
    The alignment is determined by the Block::Session_client at construction
    time and applied by the Block::Session_client::alloc_packet method.
    Block-session clients should always use this method, not the 'alloc_packet'
    method of the packet stream (tx source) directly. The latter merely
    applies a default alignment of 2 KiB.
    
    At the server side, the alignment is automatically checked by
    block/component.h (old API) and block/request_stream.h (new API).

    block/request_stream: rename wakeup_client
    
    This patch renames 'wakeup_client' to 'wakeup_client_if_needed' to
    clarify that the method triggers signals only when needed, not on every
    call.
    
    The name 'wakeup_client' is prone to misguide users to call the function
    conditionally as an optimization, thereby complicating the code, but to
    no effect.
    
    Fixes #3279

    block-request stream: split Operation from Request
    
    This patch splits the 'Request' definition into smaller types that are
    suitable for the client-side API too.
    
    The new 'Operation' type comprises the block operation's type (opcode)
    and the operation's arguments (block number, block count).
    The former 'Request::operation_defined' is now 'Operation::valid'.
    The 'Request' aggregates an 'Operation', which changes its object
    layout.
    
    Note that this commit relaxes the bit-precise definition of 'Request' to
    facilitate the use of 'unsigned long' where appropriate, in particular
    for the request tag (which should correspond to an 'Id_space::Id'). The
    originally bit-precise definition was pursued to allow the sharing of
    the 'Request' type between SPARK and C++ code. However, it turns out
    that defining a native type in each language and a (set of) converting
    constructors is a more natural approach.
    
    Issue #3283

Author: Norman Feske <norman.feske@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 9 13:58:49 2019 +0200

    block_session: add client-defined request tag
    
    The new request tag allows a block-session client to uniquely correlate
    acknowledgements with outstanding requests. Until now, this was possible
    for read and write operations by taking the value of the request's
    packet-stream offset. However, SYNC and TRIM requests do not carry any
    packet-stream payload and thereby lack meaningful offset values. By
    introducing the notion of a 'tag', we can support multiple outstanding
    requests of any type and don't need to overload the meaning of the
    'offset' value.

    block_session: SYNC and TRIM as async operations
    
    This patch removes the blocking Block::Session::sync RPC function and
    adds the asynchronous operations SYNC and TRIM to the block session's
    packet-stream interface.
    
    Even though the patch adjusts all block components to the interface
    change, the components keep the former blocking handling of sync
    internally for now because of the design of the 'Block::Driver'
    interface. This old interface is not worth changing. We should instead
    migrate the block servers step by step to the new
    'Block::Request_stream' API.
    
    Fixes #3274

    os: batching of packet-stream source operations
    
    This patch adds support for manually triggering the wakeup of the packet
    sink by the source. This way, a packet source becomes able to marshal
    batches of submissions or unmarshal batches of acknowledgements before
    yielding the control over to the sink.

    block_session: new client-side API
    
    This patch equips the 'Block::Connection' with a framework API for the
    implementation of robust block-session clients that perform block I/O in
    an asynchronous fashion.
    
    An application-defined 'JOB' type, inherited from 'Connection::Job',
    encapsulates the application's context information associated with a
    block operation.
    
    The lifecycle of the jobs is implemented by the 'Connection' and driven
    by the application's invokation of 'Connection::update_jobs'. The
    'update_jobs' mechanism takes three hook functions as arguments, which
    implement the applications-defined policy for producing and consuming
    data, and for the completion of jobs.

[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/17.05#New_API_for_user-level_timing - Two years ago]

we introduced the so-called timeout framework to provide a general solution for
requirements unmet by the bare timer-session interface - most notably
timer-session multiplexing amongst multiple timeouts and microseconds accuracy.
Up to this day, the timeout framework has proved itself many times in both
real-life appliances and artifical tests and has become the standard front end
for timing in Genode applications.

With this release, we solved one of the few remaining limitations with the
framework by enabling timeouts of up to 2^64 microseconds (> 500000 years)
across all supported architectures. In order to achieve this, we replaced the
former machine-word-wide types used for plain time values by unsigned 64-bit
integers. We did this not only inside the timeout framework but
also to almost all code in the basic Genode repositories that uses the
framework.

By doing so, we also paved the way for a second step in which we are planning
to replace plain time values as far as possible with the abstract 'Duration'
type. With this in place, the user wouldn't have to worry anymore about any
plain-integer implications when calculating with time values.


Support for chained EBR partitions
==================================

    part_block: fix handling of chained EBR's
    
    Fixes #3223.


IP forwarding with port redirection
===================================

The NIC router can now be used to redirect to individual destination ports on
port-forwarding. To express this, the new 'to_port' attritbute can be added to
'<tcp-forward>' and '<udp-forward>' rules in the NIC router configuration. If
the new attribute isn't added, the rules behave as usual and forward with an
unaltered destination port.


NIC-bridge support for ethernet multicast

Libraries, languages, and applications
######################################

Ada/SPARK runtime and SPARK-based cryptography
==============================================

The SPARK runtime has been updated to GCC 8.3. SPARK components do not
require 'Genode::Env' or a terminal session anymore. Debug message can still be
printed using 'GNAT.IO', which uses 'Genode::log' and 'Genode::error'
internally now.

Threading support, which was never fully implemented, has been removed
to further simplify the runtime. This simplification allowed us to prove
absence of runtime errors for the secondary stack allocator and other parts of
the runtime.

[https://github.com/Componolit/libsparkcrypto.git - Libsparkcrypto] is a
library of common cryptographic algorithms implemented in SPARK. It is
free-standing and has a very small footprint. The port of libsparkcrypto
for Genode has been added to the libports repository.
Thanks to Alexander Senier and Johannes Kliemann of
[https://componolit.com - Componolit] for maintaining the Ada/SPARK runtime
and libsparkcrypto.

To accommodate the use case of block encryption, we added the small wrapper
library 'aes_cbc_4k' around libsparkcrypto that provides a simple C++
interface for the en/decryption of 4 KiB data blocks. It uses AES-CBC while
incorporating the block number and the private key as salt values.


Improved resilience of sequence tool

    sequence: add keep-going feature
    
    When enabling the 'keep_going' config attribute, the component will
    carry on in case a child exited with an error. In addition, if the
    'restart' attribute is set it will start executing the children from
    the beginning.


NIC-bus server for private LANs
===============================

    Nic_bus server
    
    A minimal Nic service that switches ethernet packets between Nic
    sessions. Packets are only switched between MAC addresses of directly
    connected sessions, attaching a device driver and switching to
    additional MACs on further ethernet segments is not supported. That is
    to say that is component is neither a hub nor a switch.
    
    This server is intended for creating private LANs between components and
    supports arbitrary level 3 protocols (IPv4 and IPv6).

    remote_rom: improvements and refactoring
    
    Avoid a runtime warning message since our backend does not provide
    such constructor functions yet. If a backend requires them, it should
    initiate their execution by itself within the backend init functions.
    
    In coherence with the size_guard idea, the remote_rom packets are are
    separated into a simple layer packet and a data packet. While basically
    only managing common control informations, the layer packet may carry
    any payload. The data packet, instead, manages the transmission of the
    actual ROM payload and can be attached to the layer packet. This
    simplifies the management of the notification packets UPDATE and SIGNAL
    since they do not contain fields like 'offset' or 'payload_size'
    anymore.
    
    Now, a single thread manages all incoming RPC calls, signals and (thus)
    network packets. This will hopefully make further synchronization
    enhancements a lot easier.
    
    Further changes:
    * Following data packets are identified as such by their offset instead
      of their packet type field. This simplifies the protocol.
    * reduced redundancy in the packet building code
    * rewrap lines with >79 columns
    * fix compiler warnings
    * split backend code
    * Remove a few unnecessary include and using directives.
    * In order to avoid global variables across modules, 'verbose' is a
      member variable now. Later, its value may be set via constructor.
    * The nested Rx class is merged with Backend_base. This way, we avoid
      unnecessary maintenance as long as we don't have a clear design for
      ROM multiplexing which may require the management of multiple IP
      addresses etc.
    * The HANDLER template argument is removed since client and server
      inherit from Backend_base anyway. The receive method is virtual now.
    * The signals packet_avail and ready_to_ack are directly passed to the
      same signal handler now.
    * Remove unnecessarily public/protected visibility from some members.
    * Remove and add unnecessary and, due to inclusion order, secretly
      missing include directives, respectively.

OpenJDK improvements
====================

Within the 19.05 release cycle we further improved Genode's OpenJDK support by
enabling additional networking infrastructure required by the
[https://spring.io - Spring Framework]. The improvements  especially concern
support for SSL connections which enabled us to successfully execute an embedded
[https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-embedded-web-servers.html - Tomcat]
server natively on Genode x86 and ARMv7 platforms using the same JAR archive.
This line of work continues our Java for embedded systems effort as described in
our [http://genodians.org/ssumpf/2019-02-27-java-19-02 - Boot2Java] article.

Having these features in place, our Java efforts will continue in the direction
of Java Swing and the support of input devices in the future, with the ultimate
goal of seamless Java application integration into Sculpt OS.

    sel4: update tools to currently used version 9.0.x
    
    Until now, Genode referenced a fork of the outdated elfloader-tool
    to enable bootstrapping of sel4 on ARM platforms. Because the
    elfloader is inherently dependent on the used platforms newer
    ARM versions supported by the kernel could not be loaded by the
    outdated elfloader. This commit uses a fresh fork of the nowadays
    used sel4_tools repository.

Tooling and build system
########################

Improved handling of missing ports
==================================

The depot tools 'tool/depot/create' and 'tool/depot/extract' now detect and
report all missing third-party sources - called ports - for a given set of
archives at once. Additionally, the user can tell the tools to download and
prepare such missing ports automatically by setting the environment variable
'PREPARE_PORTS' to '1' (Please be aware that doing so may cause downloads and
file operations in your 'contrib' directory without further interaction). These
features make building archives with dependencies to many ports more enjoyable.
If you merely need a list of ports that are missing for your archives, you can
use the new tool 'tool/depot/missing_ports'.

For more details you may read the
[http://www.genodians.org/m-stein/2019-05-21-depot-missing-ports - article on genodians.org] .


Automated depot management
==========================

When using the 'import_from_depot' mechanism of the run tool, one frequently
encounters a situation where the depot lacks a particular archive.
Whenever the run tool detects such a situation, it prompts the user to
manually curate the depot content via the _tool/depot/create_ tool.
The need for such manual steps negatively interferes with the development
workflow. The right manual steps are sometimes not straight-forward to find,
in particular after switching between Git branches.

To relieve the developer from this uncreative manual labor, we extended the
run tool with the option '--depot-auto-update' for managing the depot
automatically according to the needs of the executed run script. To enable
this option, use the following line in the build configuration:

! RUN_OPT += --depot-auto-update

If enabled, the run tool automatically invokes the right
depot-management commands to populate the depot with the required archives,
and to ensure the consistency of the depot content with the current version of
the source tree. The feature comes at the price of a delay when executing the
run script because the consistency check involves the extraction of all used
source archives from the source tree. In regular run scripts, this delay
is barely noticeable. Only when working with a run script of a large system,
it may be better to leave the depot auto update disabled.

Please note that the use of the automated depot update may result in version
updates of the corresponding depot recipes in the source tree (recipe hash
files). It is a good practice to review and commit those hash files once the
local changes in the source tree have reached a good shape.
